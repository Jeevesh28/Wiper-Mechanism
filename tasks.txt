Tasks for 7/10 - 7/25 iteration:

1) Restyle previously made examples to fit new style as suggested in 7/10 meeting:
	a) Resize canvas and rescale examples to fit better in lagrange site (see http://lagrange.mechse.illinois.edu/mwest/tam212/rvv.xhtml for examples)
	b) Change basis vectors to be unit vectors
	c) Work on getting LaTeX text in canvas working (start with email suggestion from Professor West, ask for help later?)
	d) Redo changing basis examples to remove animations.  Make it so a button toggles between three states: first basis, second basis, and both bases.

2) Create detailed application example for a Fourbar Linkage similar to Professor West's "Acceleration and Braking" example (see http://lagrange.mechse.illinois.edu/mwest/tam212/ava.xhtml for examples).

Possible ideas:
	a) A Watt's Linkage in the rear-suspension of a car (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt's_linkage#Automobile_suspension)
	b) Fourbar linkage used in a bike's suspension (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_suspension#Four-bar)
	c) Watt's linkage in train-suspension (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Suspension_train_watt.svg)

3) Create webpage for use during the August 1 SIIP meeting.  Should include links to our best examples on the lagrange website.  Make sure links follow a logical path to highlight the new TAM 212 website (be sure to hit the Reference and Application pages).

4) Continue making examples from "tam212.pdf" in SVN repository for the lagrange website.
